\title{
Proportion of the molecule metabolised by the CYPs for a child according to age.
}

\description{
Proportion of the molecule metabolised by the CYPs. A weighted sum is computed. For each CYP, the proportion metabolised in adults is multiplied with the fraction of CYP (KCYP) available for a child according to age. 
} 

\usage{
weightCYPsum(age, percCYP)
}

\arguments{
    \item{age}{
		The age of child.
    }
    \item{percCYP}{
        Dataframe giving the percentage of the molecule metabolised for each cytochrome in adults. Dataframe with two column - column 1: CYP name, column 2: percentage of the molecule metabolised.
    }
